I'm really proud of myself for being able to learn React in such a short amount of time, while also using all the necessary tools required for the project.

However, I did face some difficulties during the project. One of the main issues I had was with integrating Material theme UI and understanding React. Additionally, setting up the system for cookies was a bit challenging, so I had to resort to using localStorage instead, even though it's less secure.

It was a great learning experience, and I was able to successfully complete the project within the given timeframe. I'm particularly happy that I'm now able to incorporate Tailwindcss, Formik, and yup for managing forms and validation.
